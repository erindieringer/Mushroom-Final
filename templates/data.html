    		<h1> About the Data Set <h1>
    		<p> The dataset that we used was from Kaggle and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification">here</a>.  </p>
    		<p> The data is a training set that we used to classify mushrooms as edible or not edible based on 22 features that were given in the set. </p>
    		<p> To view our classification algorithms go to this <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hexingren/Projects/Data%20Pipeline/final/Mushrooms%21%21.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook.</a></p>

    	<h3> Expert research </h3>
    	<p> We interviewed the President and Vice President of the Western Pennsylvania Mushroom Club. Below are the questions we asked them. </p>
    	<p><ol>
    		<li>What is the first thing you teach new students about mushroom safety? </li>
    		<li>Can you describe some of the most important visual cues for mushroom identification?</li>
    		<li>What about other cues like feel or smell?</li>
    		<li>What features are easy for beginners to recognize?</li>
    		<li>What about things that are hard to identify?</li>
    		<li>How do you teach beginner students?</li>
    		<li>What are some of the misconceptions that students have about mushroom hunting? </li>
    		<li>What are the most important things to know about mushroom hunting?</li>
    		<li>What resources would you recommend?</li>
    	</ol><p>
    	<p>Each of the interviewees gave our team important information about mushroom hunting. The first thing they cover when teaching beginners are safety issues.
    	Safety is an important issue in mushroom hunting, and both of the experts expressed the importance of identifying mushrooms at the species level to be sure 
    	if it is edible or not. Both interviewees talked about Amanita mushrooms since they contain some of the most deadly mushroom species, the Destroying Angel 
    	and the Death Cap. Both interviewees mentioned habitat, population, caps, gills, spore color, and stems as being important features to look for when 
    	mushroom hunting. We decided to include the features that the experts thought were important into the teaching portion of our content. </p>
